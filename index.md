### CPSC 120 My Favorite Lab

* Lab 7, part 1

    This is my favorite, when i started with this part, it feels like im coding a small game, this part assigned us to code the parking sign, which time and date that we can park, on each street, ask us to check each of the sign really carefully. Actually, this is the longest code that i've been write since lab 1, it's really fun though. After the lab i was able to deal with long code, handle it better and check it more carefully.

* Lab 5, part 1

  This is my most favorite part among lab 1 to lab 12, this was my first time do number calculating by coding, it super cool. This lab required us to calculate the area of a rectangle, by enter inputs were length and width, then it will calculate the area. After the lab i was able to know how to do calculating in coding.

* Lab 4, part 1

  This is one of my favorite parts too, it helps me to be able to know how to convert value between each object, this part asked us to convert between tablespoons, teaspoon, ounces and cups. After the lab i was be able to do double function more skillfully, faster and feel more familiar, no matter how many double function were dealt.
